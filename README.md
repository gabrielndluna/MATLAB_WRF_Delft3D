# MATLAB_WRF_Delft3D
This repository has MATLAB codes to process WRF outputs and format them to use in Delft 3D Flow module. Also there's a script to read the results of Flow into matlab.

**WRF_to_Delft3D:** Matlab codes for conversion of WRF output variables to space/time varying forcing files for Delft3D simulation. Converts Spherical to Cartesian coordinate system and structures the data so it can be received in Delft3D.

**Extraction_Flow_output:** Converts NETCDF output of WRF model to txt files structured in a way so it can be read by Delft3D.
